# CoffeeShop Application

## Description
The **CoffeeShop Application** is a simple Python-based console program that simulates a coffee shop's order management system. It allows users (customers) to view the menu, place orders, check inventory, and view the total sales. The application supports multiple orders in one session and updates the inventory and sales dynamically based on customer purchases.

---

## Features
- **Menu Display**: Shows the available items and their respective prices.
- **Order System**: Customers can place multiple orders, specifying quantities. The application checks if the requested items are available in the inventory and processes the order accordingly.
- **Inventory Management**: Tracks the stock of each item in the inventory. If an item is out of stock, the customer is notified.
- **Sales Tracking**: Tracks total sales made during the session and allows users to view the total amount of revenue generated.
- **Order Confirmation**: Customers can review and confirm their orders before the transaction is finalized.
